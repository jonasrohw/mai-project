After the war the mountain turned from a battleground to being famous for its beautiful temples and theme park.\n\t\n\tAt 996 metres (3,268 ft), the extinct volcano rises from the flat Mekong Delta jungle and farmland. The mountain is almost a perfect cinder cone with a saddle and a slight bulge on her northwest side. The mountain is honeycombed with caves and is covered in many large basalt boulders.[2]The mountain is located approximately 10 km northeast of T\u00e2y Ninh and 96 km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\t\n\tHistory\n\tPre-Vietnam War\n\tVariations of the legend of N\u00fai B\u00e0 ", "og:url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aciamax/galleries/72157669135889552", "twitter:player:width": "640", "twitter:app:name:iphone": "Flickr"}], "cse_image": [{"src": "https://live.staticflickr.com/3688/9783793314_dab0eea071_b.jpg"}]}}, {"kind": "customsearch#result", "title": "Spaghetti feed is rare event in desert", "htmlTitle": "Spaghetti feed is rare event in desert", "link": "https://www.nationalguard.mil/Resources/Archives/The-On-Guard/FileId/63083/", "displayLink": "www.nationalguard.mil", "snippet": "Someone announced, \"Hey, the Airborne Division in Vietnam from ... be over, but another war continues-- 1991, the Army National Guard lost.", "htmlSnippet": "Someone announced, &quot;Hey, the Airborne <b>Division</b> in <b>Vietnam</b> from ... be over, but another <b>war</b> continues-- 1991, the Army National Guard lost.", "cacheId": "HRXusHg_wHAJ", "formattedUrl": "https://www.nationalguard.mil/Resources/Archives/The-On.../63083/", "htmlFormattedUrl": "https://www.nationalguard.mil/Resources/Archives/The-On.../63083/", "pagemap": {"cse_thumbnail": [{"src": "https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS5Db5DR2AxnHXSbTOJfHPVfSg1PcB3PuEHwvkY3o7UhJ2jJZ4qWgXwoB4s", "width": "280", "height": "180"}], "metatags": [{"moddate": "D:20100624145328-04'00'", "creationdate": "D:20100610154255-04'00'"}], "cse_image": [{"src": "x-raw-image:///1cab30f052ae59993a50309390bbbbb180779f70317be8268c49c0b15865718c"}]}, "mime": "application/pdf", "fileFormat": "PDF/Adobe Acrobat"}, {"kind": "customsearch#result", "title": "4th Bn. 9th Infantry \"Manchu\" Vietnam", "htmlTitle": "4th Bn. 9th <b>Infantry</b> &quot;Manchu&quot; <b>Vietnam</b>", "link": "http://www.manchu.org/country/scrapbook/", "displayLink": "www.manchu.org", "snippet": "Image Carl Olin (with M 60) ahead of Carl is probably Rick Schultz.
