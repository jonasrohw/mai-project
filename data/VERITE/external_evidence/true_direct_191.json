One reason for this was that industrial employers began to decrease working hours and institute a Saturday half-day holiday, which gave workers more free time for leisure activities. (Other types of workplaces would soon follow suit.) Vacations began to be regularly offered to workers, although they were usually unpaid ones. The monotony of specialized industrial work and the crowding of urban expansion also created a desire in the worker to have leisure time away from his or her job and away from the bustle of the city. The Progressive movement was another factor which contributed to the increased value of leisure time for workers, as their health and well-being received more attention. Yet another factor was the installation of electric lighting in the city streets, which made nighttime leisure activities less dangerous for both sexes.", "og:image:secure_url": "https://www.loc.gov/static/images/favicons/open-graph-logo.png", "twitter:site": "librarycongress", "dc.source": "Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA", "dc.type": "web page", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "dc.title": "America at Leisure \u00a0|\u00a0Articles and Essays \u00a0|\u00a0America at Work, America at Leisure: Motion Pictures from 1894-1915 \u00a0|\u00a0Digital Collections \u00a0|\u00a0Library of Congress", "fb:admins": "libraryofcongress", "dc.language": "eng"}], "cse_image": [{"src": "http://www.loc.gov/static/images/favicons/open-graph-logo.png"}]}}, {"kind": "customsearch#result", "title": "San Francisco Recreation and Parks, CA | Official Website", "htmlTitle": "San Francisco Recreation and Parks, CA | Official Website", "link": "https://sfrecpark.org/", "displayLink": "sfrecpark.org", "snippet": "Free Concerts in Golden Gate Park, UN Plaza, Main Library & Across SF for Make Music Day.
