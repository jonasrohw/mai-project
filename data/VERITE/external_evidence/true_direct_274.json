Due to a mistake in handing the correct envelope to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway,\u00a0Moonlight\u00a0was then declared the actual winner in a bizarre moment when La La\u00a0producer Jordan Horowitz \u00a0had to stop everything in its tracks and tell the audience his movie was not the winner after all.\r\n\r\nIt was definitely a say what? moment for the ages. Sadly, it marred an otherwise flawless Oscarcast produced by Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd and hosted supremely by Jimmy Kimmel in top form -- the best and most consistent host I have seen do this almost impossible show since Johnny Carson.
