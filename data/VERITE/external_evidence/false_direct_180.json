It builds on analysis of three distinct topics: social networking, propaganda, and news and information sharing. Two case studies are used to show how state and nonstate actors use social media to employ time-tested propaganda techniques to yield far-reaching results. The spread of the propaganda message is accomplished by tapping into an existing narrative, then amplifying that message with a network of automatic \u201cbot\u201d accounts to force the social media platform algorithm to recognize that message as a trending topic. The Islamic State and Russia provide evidence of successful influence operations using social media.  The 2016 election proved that using social media to influence political outcomes is highly effective. Coercion and persuasion will continue to be decisive factors in information warfare as more countries attempt to build influence operations on social media.", "producer": "Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1", "title": "Commanding the Trend:  Social Media as Information Warfare"}], "cse_image": [{"src": "x-raw-image:///0a120e2bc56b4be0da597b13cac344b98f8295888d86e61a9483117c4ce1383a"}]}, "mime": "application/pdf", "fileFormat": "PDF/Adobe Acrobat"}, {"kind": "customsearch#result", "title": "'Every Day Was Like a \u201cVeep\u201d Episode': The Veepiest Moments of ...", "htmlTitle": "&#39;Every Day Was Like a \u201cVeep\u201d Episode&#39;: The Veepiest Moments of ...", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/06/trump-veep-moments-435749", "displayLink": "www.politico.com", "snippet": "Dec 6, 2020 ...
