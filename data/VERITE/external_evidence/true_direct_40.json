While sailing, fishers paddle collaboratively when the wind is low and when the boat is leaking, some crew will bail the vessel.

If successful, the fishers collect their catch, weigh the anchor, return to shore, and prepare to sell their fish. These fishing activities have always been accompanied by maritime customs, traditions, rituals, stories, and gestures. For instance, singing is one key tradition that has continued to accompany the fishing process from the start to the end.
