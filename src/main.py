### The collected evidence are provided. But if you need to re-collect them, uncomment the following:
### It will require the installation of Google API with 'pip install google-api-python-client'
# collect_evidence(data_path = '/VERITE', API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY", CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID = "YOUR_ID")

### Î™f you need to download the VERITE images, uncomment the following: 
# download_images(data_path = '/VERITE')

### The 'VERITE_with_evidence.csv' file is provided. But if you need to re-create it, uncomment the following: 
# save_verite_file(data_path = '/VERITE')

extract_encoder_features(data_path=VERITE_PATH, images_path=VERITE_PATH, data_name='VERITE', output_path=VERITE_PATH)
   
### Extract CLIP features for the external evidence of NewsCLIPings
extract_features_for_evidence(data_path = DATA_PATH, output_path= EVIDENCE_PATH, data_name_X=DATA_NAME_X)

### Evidence re-ranking module for NewsCLIPings
re_rank_evidence(data_path=DATA_PATH, data_name=DATA_NAME, data_name_X=DATA_NAME_X, output_path=EVIDENCE_PATH)

### CLIP features for VERITE are provided. If you want to re-extract them, uncomment the following: 
# extract_features_for_evidence(data_path = VERITE_PATH, output_path=VERITE_PATH, data_name_X="VERITE_external")

### Ranked evidence for VERITE are provided. If you want to re-calculate them, uncomment the following: 
# re_rank_verite(data_path=VERITE_PATH, data_name="VERITE", output_path=DATA_NAME)
