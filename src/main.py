### It will require the installation of Google API with 'pip install google-api-python-client'

### Î™f you need to download the VERITE images, uncomment the following: 
#download_images(data_path = VERITE_PATH)

### The 'VERITE_with_evidence.csv' file is provided. But if you need to re-create it, uncomment the following: 
# save_verite_file(data_path = VERITE_PATH)
